# scheduleMe

## Description 📜
Module 5 requires students to build a scheduler featuring dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Motivation 💪🏻
This project is to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Build status 🏗
* The starter code has been built by Birmigham University. The assignment requires me to add updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. 

## Code style 🔐
* Standard HTML and CSS has been used for this project. 
* The language for the website is written in US English. (USA English)

## Acceptance Criteria ✅
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
* WHEN I open the planner
    THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
* WHEN I scroll down
    THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
* WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
    THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
* WHEN I click into a timeblock
    THEN I can enter an event
* WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
    THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
* WHEN I refresh the page
    THEN the saved events persist.
